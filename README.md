# ios-assignment

### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features



### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
- Areas that I prioritized was making sure I was able to decode the data using concurrency before moving to UI
- Once got the UI to how I wanted it, then I would refactor to conform to MVVM architecture and simplify my views
- Also did some accessibility for voice over
- Then worked on unit testing since it was relatively new for me in the iOS space

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
- I broke my tasks down by how I wanted to do the project. Decoding the json data needed and making sure I handled the errors
- I then worked on UI and refactoring to separate UI from view model and any optimizations needed.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
- I initially thought of doing iOS16 but later realized that one feature I wanted to implement would be more time consuming when it wasn't necessary for me to work on it and just personally liked it, so I went with iOS17

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
- I intially struggled a lot with unit tests and how to set it up and looked online for any tips from developers. I think I was able to accomplish this task and would like to work on it some more to improve building iOS apps with more unit testing.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
